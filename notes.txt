	color => always (default), never, auto (only with a terminal)
	u, --time=atime/access/use => print access time instead of modification time 
	i => show inode column
	time => specify which time to print and/or use for sorting
	1 => force single line
	wX / --width=X => manually fix width of columns in chars
Filtering : a, A, d
	a => accept .
	A => -a without . and ..
	d => only info about the given directory in arg

Ordering : r, t, U, u, sort
	r => reverse
	t => sort by modification time
	U => do not sort
	u => sort by access time (except if used with -l without -t)
	S => sort by file size, largest first
	sort => specify sorting type

Recursive : R,
	for each folder listed, repeat the command
		- as if the folder itself was inserted as the next argument

Shortcut : f
	f => disable color, add -a -U

if 


non-alphanum chars must be within quotes

If more than one argument or Recursive, special format

1: parsing
	- parse entries
		- get flags
		- get info
		- check filters
			- -a/-a for hidden folders
		- if folder, add to sorted list of folders, except if -d
		- if files or (-d flag), add to sorted list of files
	- print list of files
	- loop folders :
		- print directory name if not single arg or if recursive
		- generate and print list of file
			- if recursive, each directory is appended as the next folder in the list


Token element :
	- a list of file (only for multiple args)
		- sort by insertion or in place
		- print files
	- a directory
		
Column formatting:
	157 files over 7 columns
		7 * 22 files + 3 files
	157 files over 6 columns
		6 * 26 files + 1 file
	- 31 + 2
	-
